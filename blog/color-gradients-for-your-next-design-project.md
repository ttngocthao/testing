title: Color Gradients For Your Next Design Project
shortIntro: Software and design company Itmeo has created a useful online tool
  called WebGradients – a free collection of 180 linear gradients that you can
  use as content backdrops in any part of your website. You can download a .PNG
  version of each gradient and copy their CSS3 cross-browser codes. Sketch and
  Photoshop packs are available as well. Here are some of our favourites from
  the collection.
