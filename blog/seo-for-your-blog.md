paragraph:
  - paragraphText: Website visitors searching long-tail keywords are more likely to
      read the whole post and then seek more information from you. In other
      words, they'll help you generate right type of traffic — visitors who
      convert.

    paragraphHeading: 1. Focus on 1–2 long-tail keywords that match the intent of
      your target reader.
  - paragraphHeading: 2. Include these 1–2 keywords in specific parts of your post.
    paragraphText: "There are four essential places where you should try to include
      your keywords: title tag, headers & body, URL, and meta description."
  - paragraphHeading: 3. Make sure your blog is mobile-friendly (or has a responsive design).
    paragraphText: Websites that are responsive to mobile allow blog pages to have
      just one URL instead of two — one for desktop and one for mobile,
      respectively. This helps your post's SEO because any inbound links that
      come back to your site won't be divided between the separate URLs.  As a
      result, you'll centralize the SEO power you gain from these links, helping
      Google more easily recognize your post's value and rank it accordingly.
