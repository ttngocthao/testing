  - paragraphHeading: 01. Font selection
    paragraphText: "Font design is a long and involved process. Typefaces are
      created by craftspeople over a substantial period of time, using talent
      honed over many years. The best, professionally designed fonts come with
      various weights and styles to form a complete family, plus carefully
      considered kerning pairs, multi-language support with international
      characters and expressive alternate glyphs to add character and variety to
      typesetting. "

  - paragraphHeading: 02. Size
    paragraphText: All typefaces are not created equal. Some are fat and wide; some
      are thin and narrow. So words set in different typefaces can take up a
      very different amount of space on the page.
