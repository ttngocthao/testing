      in nature, and it can also be used to achieve beauty, balance and harmony
      in art, design ( such as: architecture, logos, UI Design…) and
      photography. A Fibonacci sequence starting with 0 and 1. The previous two
      numbers are added together to produce the next number in the sequence:
      0,1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, … and so on to infinity."
