      - paragraph: HSBC set us the challenge of updating how ‘Learning’ was branded,
          structured, positioned, communicated and delivered throughout the
          business. HSBC University was the result, bringing together the many
          varied learning areas from across the business, including Leadership,
          Risk, Strategy & Performance into a structured and easily accessible
          brand.
      - paragraph: The visual brand brings this all to life and was created to be
          distinctive, flexible and easy to implement across all media whilst
          adhering to the tight HSBC brand guidelines.
